# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the survival chances of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset, available on Kaggle, includes features like age, gender, class, fare, and others that describe the passengers. By analyzing these features, the project seeks to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Steps Followed in the Project

### 1. Data Preprocessing
The Titanic dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical variables.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to visualize the data and gain insights into survival rates among different groups of passengers.

### 3. Machine Learning Models
Various machine learning models, such as Decision Trees and Logistic Regression, were trained using Scikit-learn and evaluated on test data.

### 4. Model Evaluation
The accuracy and performance of the models were evaluated, and improvements were suggested based on the results.
